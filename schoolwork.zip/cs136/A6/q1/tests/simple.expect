Seven kids, named Lesley, Rosina, Albert, Dan, Dave, Nomair and Tyler,
went on their bikes to go to a playground 1.50 kilometers away from
their complex. They were all excited to spend 2 hours playing there
together. When they arrived, they heard 10 bells ringing from a nearby
ice-cream truck. Following their natural instincts, they ran to the truck
immediately. Each ice-cream cone costs $2.00, but the kids forgot to bring
their money! Lucky for them, the ice-cream lady had had a good day, she
decided to give each of them ice cream for free :-)
Lesley requested 2 cones.
Rosina requested 1 cone.
Albert requested 5 cones.
Albert was a greedy kid.
