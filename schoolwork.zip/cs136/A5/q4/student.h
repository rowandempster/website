//     NONE: number of courses = 0          [no status]
//     FRW:  number of failed courses > 4   [required to withdraw]
//     FRW:  # of fails > # of passes       [required to withdraw]
//     NOCS: number of cs courses = 0       [no cs status]
//     FLPP: CS_AVG < 60 and CAV < 60       [must leave plan]
//     PRBO: CAV < 60                       [probation]
//     CNDP: CS_AVG < 60                    [conditional standing]
//     GOOD: 60 <= CAV < 80                 [good]

//   of a user-defined type are equal. Therefore, we must implement our own. 
//   Checking for equality does not mean checking whether the pointers
//   point to the same instance, but rather checking the contents of each
//   field for equality.  (checking just the id is also not sufficient)


// can_graduate(&s) determines if student s is eligible for graduation.
//   To graduate, a student must:
//     * have passed at least 40 courses, at least 15 of which must be CS
//     * have a status of GOOD or EXCL (see above)
