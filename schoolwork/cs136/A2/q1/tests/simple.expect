Hello,

This is a test to see if you can use the C printf function in CS 136.

Watch your spacing very carefully.
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can assume there are no spaces at the end of the lines.

One restriction: you cannot use numbers directly.

So the fun numbers 1337, 4010 and 8675309 must be printed using %d.

Just like %, to print a backslash (\) you actually need to use two (\\).

Don't forget to put a newline (\n) at the end of the last line.
